# Computational Thinking

A lesson for people who want to learn about programming, but do not want to
learn how to program.

- What is computational thinking?
  - Important elements [3]
    * Logical Thinking
    * Algorithmic Thinking
    * Efficient Solutions
    * Scientific Thinking
    * Innovative Thinking
  - Concepts and approaches of the computational thinker [4]
    * Concepts
      * Logic - predicting and analysing
      * Algorithms - making steps and rules
      * Decomposition - breaking down into parts
      * Patterns - spotting and using similarities
      * Abstraction - removing unnecessary detail
      * Evaluation - making judgment
    * Approaches
      * Tinkering - experimenting and playing
      * Creating - designing and making
      * Debugging - finding and fixing errors
      * Persevering - keep going
      * Collaborating - working together
- Why is it useful?
- What is the goal of the lesson?

The idea is to explain computational concepts by collectively solving puzzles from
the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO) [1, 2].

What computational concepts should be explored?

* Algorithm

Types of problems [1]

- Assembly required
- Black box
- Broken machine
- Troublemaker
- Jabberwock
- Combinations

Other requirements

* Problems should be self contained (not require additional knowledge)
